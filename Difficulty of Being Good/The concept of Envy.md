# The Concept of Envy

At the point of writing this, I've progressed much ahead in reading The Difficulty of being good but I still feel that the first chapter (Duryodhana's Envy) is by far the most intense and relatable pieces of writing I have ever read. In my opinion, Envy is a feeling that is as ubiquitous as attraction, similar to the fact that everyone (irrespective of what they tell you) has someone they are attracted to and would like to be involved with them in some good (or kinky!) way, everyone also has atleast one person who they are envious of and would like to defeat or outshine them in some way. d to but still so less talked about. After reading about it from TDOBG, I realised that this is a domain where diving deeper is imperative in order to know my own emotions better and would set the red flags early in situations where I see the patterns repeating because if you feel that love or attraction is the only emotion that induces stupidity in humans, wait till envy hits you.
