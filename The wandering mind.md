I watched a TEDx video that talked about focus. Most of it was the stuff I had already heard like how smartphones create addictive stimulations and how reducing dopamine hits could lead to better attention spans. But there was one thing that hit me real hard. The speaker said that we're doing so stuff nowadays much that our mind does not wander anymore. In our attempt to fit in, we are doing so much of what is expected of us that we do not think of anything else anymore. It does not mean that are minds aren't occupied, thet are indeed more occupied than ever. They are occupied with what we did, what we're doing and what we would do next.
