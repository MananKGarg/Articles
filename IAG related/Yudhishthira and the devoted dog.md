## Yudhishthira and the Devoted Dog

So today I read the story about about ardent Dharma follower Yudhishthira giving up heaven for the sake of an 'unclean' dog which had followed him along the way in his journey towards the Himalayas. Near the end of Mahabharata, when the Pandavas had ruled their kingdom for many years and all characters except them and Draupadi were long dead, they crowned Parikshit (Arjuna's grandson) as king and decided to ascent towards Mount Sumeru, the gateway to heaven. To reach Mount Sumeru, they had to cross the mighty Himalayas. A dog also joins them in their journey as it keps following Yudhishthira. They kept trudging through the difficult terrain and afterwards started to fall one by one because of harsh conditions. Draupadi falls first, followed by Sahadeva, Nakul, Arjun and Bheem. Mahabharata describes the reasons of their fall, their weaknesses at length but that is a discussion for some other day. So, At last, only Yudhishthira and the dog are able to reach Mount Sumeru and complete the journey. 

Indra, the king of heaven descends on his splendid chariot, praises Yudhishthira for his qualities and invites him in his chariot so that he could take him to heaven. Yudhishthira and the dog both start moving towards the chariot. Indra exclaims, 'The dog cannot come' . Yudhishthira tells Indra that the dog was with him and had also successfully completed the journey on the harsh path to heaven and thus, should also come to heaven. Indra tells Yudhishthira that heaven is not attainable by all, the dog is thin, old , unclean and has little to no value and denies the entry of dog in his chariot. After hearing this, Yudhishthira replies, "In that case, I do not seek heaven. The dog was my faithful companion and I cannot abandon it. It sought my help and gave me unconditional love. The pleasures of heaven will mean nothing to me in comparison to its grief. It has done nothing to deserve abandonment and had none of the weaknesses of my wife and brothers. Also, dharma states that abandoning someone devoted to you, is a bottomless evil. If the dog does not deserve to go to heaven, then neither do I." and he turns back. 

The god, Dharma (Yudhishthira's father) who had been present all along in guise as the meek dog, transforms himself in his actual form and praises Yudhishtira fro his virtue and tells him that it was a test which he had passed. He would now be able to go to heaven with a special privilege of keeping his own body (others who went to heaven were given a different 'heavenly body'). Difficulty of Being Good describes this incident to talk about compassion. It says that compassion is the highest dharma and Yudhishthura exhibited this quality when he was compassionate about the dog. He related to the grief the dog would feel when it would come to know that the one it devoted itself to left it to die in this harsh climate. Yudhishthra was able to put himself in the dog's place and realised how unfair it would be to the dog if he left it and dur to Yudhishthira's act of selfless compassion, he was able to get to heaven.

Difficulty of being good says that being compassionate was a great virtue of Yudhishthira but according to me, that wasn't the hardest part. In my opinion, the hardest part was when he denied heaven to act on his compassion, when he let go all the joys, all the end of suffering, all the benefits of heaven for the sake of the dog. That was the moment when I feel he was actually tested. This story sparked some scenarios in my mind. I was instantly seeing some scene from a movie where an extremely rich and villanious person asks the  protagonist to come with him and he would have all he wanted. But only he could come and not his family. His family had helped the protagonist achieve what he is but now he was being asked to abndon them. As far as I remember, these kind of stories went in two directions. First, the protagonist accepts the offer, has a good life for a while but then realises that his family or friends were inportant. Second, he denies the offer, sticks with his family, rich man makes his and his family's life difficult but the family sticks together and they eventually defeat the rich man in some way.

This scenario was an easy one and almost all of us feel that sticking to his family was the right decision on the protagonist's part. We would agree that the protagonist putting himself in his family's shoes before thinking about his own joy is something that is the obvious and morally right to do but still, we fail to practice it most of the times. We fail to practice it when we
